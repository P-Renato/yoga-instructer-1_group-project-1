The year is nearly over – what do you want to let go of?  What do you want to keep? This event is a celebration of our 2024. Through meditative movement and ecstatic dance we will wander through different aspects of our being. We will create and feel the symbiosis of stillness and chaos. From awareness to chaos to inner peace – a journey like life.",
